# wolfOS 1.5

![wolfOS in operation](wolfos-title.jpg "wolfOS 1.5 in operation")

Originally made for Hal-Con 2017, this version has been updated for the Spring Geequinox 2018. It's meant to be played in the Lynx browser on a Raspberry Pi:

`sudo apt-get lynx`

Install Nginx or the webserver of your choice and clone into in `/var/www/html`. Start the server, then run

`lynx localhost/wolfOS`

Press `o` to go into the options and set the User Mode to `Advanced` to get rid of the navigation tips at the bottom of the screen. Accept settings.
