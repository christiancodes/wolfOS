# wolfOS

This is a small game made for Hal-Con 2017. It's meant to be played in the Lynx browser on a Raspberry Pi:

`sudo apt-get lynx`

Install Nginx or the webserver of your choice and put all game files in `/var/www/html`. Start the server, then run

`lynx localhost`

Press `o` to go into the options and set the User Mode to `Advanced` to get rid of the navigation tips at the bottom of the screen. Accept settings.

You may need to set your Nginx default MIME type to `text/html` so it renders the pages without extensions.
