<p>Hi Christian,</p>

<p>When are you officially launching <em>The Calico Brief</em>? I've been telling all my friends about it, but they can't find it online and so are beginning to suspect I'm a few kittens short of a litter. I'm trying to stay paw-sitive, but things aren't feline good for me right meow. If you could let me know when you're launching it, that would be purrrfect.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
- Tommy C.
