<p>HEY!</p>

<p>What gives with the <em>GHOSTCRIME</em> cover?! <em>Boku no Magnetifax: Doki Doki Youkai</em> CLEARLY shows that Stebbins' terrible coat has classic peak lapels and doublewide shoulder pads! This is as bad as when <tt>Flyknife Comics</tt> launched their adaptation of <em>Starbreakers</em> with that awful 'rainbow in space' look!</p>

<p>Yrs etc,</p>
