<p>Hey C,</p>

<p>Had to make a new email account because my messages weren't getting through?</p>

<p>Just wondering if you'd reconsidered doing a crossover between our two series? I know you said that the idea of adding <em>Imminent Danger</em> aliens into your <tt>Snapback</tt> world is 'unnecessary' and 'kind of stupid,' but I really think it's a winner. Just imagine the fan reaction if Felix is playing Go one day, and then six-armed lizard-men bust through the door firing laser guns and haul him off into space. He could play Space Go! There's really no downside.</p>

<p>Will touch base with you soon,</p>
- M
