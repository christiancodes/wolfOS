<p>Hey Christian!</p>

<p>This project has been great and you're lovely to work with and everything, but if you want me to work on <em>Snapback Vol. 3</em> we have to talk. You can't keep sending me instructions using Go symbolism and code. It's really slowing things down. I'm so tired Christian. I have a life.</p>

<p>Anyway if you insist on this next time, I'm gonna charge triple. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>My love,</p>
Dawn
