<p>HEY!</p>

<p>What gives with the Ghostcrime cover?! Boku no Magnetifax: Doki Doki Youkai CLEARLY shows that Stebbins' terrible coat has classic peak lapels and doublewide shoulder pads! This is as bad as when Flyknife Comics launched their adaptation of <em>Starbreakers</em> with that awful 'rainbow in space' look!</p>
